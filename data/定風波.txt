定風波：港府勿再沽名釣譽	

"""
斬草不除根，春風吹又生。針對積重難返的南亞假難民問題......

不管高官如何鼓其如簧之舌，大肆吹噓積壓的酷刑聲請個案有所減少，
但市民面對的現實卻是，全港各區相繼被假難民大軍攻陷，
由深水埗通州街天橋底的南亞村，到整個油尖旺地區，再到新界的元朗屯門，
概莫能外，香港再難尋得一片淨土。

日前有調查顯示，多達三分之一港人有移民意願，假難民肆虐導致市民難以「出入平安」，
顯然是原因之一。

即使退一萬步說，港府花費大量資源應對假難民問題，先不說用於審核個案、
打擊黑工等的人手，假難民的衣食住行、官司費用等，每年也要花費十億元以上公帑，
一旦香港對假難民即捕即解，或設置禁閉式難民營，將相關社會成本用於幫助真正有需要的港人身上，
能解決多少問題？

If you don't get rid of the grass,

The recurring problem of South Asian fake refugees...

No matter how much the senior officials pontificate and boast 
about the reduction of the backlog of torture claims,
the reality is that the whole territory has been overrun by an army of bogus refugees.
From Nanya Village under the Tung Chau Street flyover in Sham Shui Po, 
to the entire Yau Tsim Mong area, to Tuen Mun, Yuen Long in the New Territories, 
all of them have been overrun by fake refugees.
There is no other way to find a clean slate in Hong Kong.

A few days ago, a survey showed that as many as one-third of Hong Kong 
people have the intention to emigrate, and it is difficult for people to 
go out safely because of the rampant fake refugees, 
which is obvious a reason why people want to emigrate. 

Even if we take a step back and say that the Government spends a lot of resources 
to deal with the problem of bogus refugees, not to mention the manpower used to examine cases, 
crack down on illegal workers, etc., the cost of clothing, food, 
housing and transportation for bogus refugees, as well as the cost of legal proceedings, 
will cost more than $1 billion of public money every year.

If Hong Kong arrested, discharged fake refugees and set up closed camps for refugees, 
how many problems can be solved instead by spending the money
on helping Hong Kong people in genuine need?
