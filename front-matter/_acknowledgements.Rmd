I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the people who have offered enormous support to me throughout my study at the Graduate Institute. First of all, my parents, Mr. Kwan Lam Cheong and Ms. Tam Suk Yee, have always supported me in every stage of my life. Without them I would not have been who I am today.
