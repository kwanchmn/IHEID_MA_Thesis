假難民嚴重威脅社區治安

"""
劉佩玉認為，目前的酷刑聲請問題亦會對香港的種族共融工作帶來極大負面影響，
因為循酷刑聲請來港的部分假難民，在破壞社區治安、環境的同時，
亦使在港少數族裔人士的形象大打折扣，而這部分在香港土生土長的少數族裔人士，
許多都幾代人以香港為家，認同香港社會的價值觀，是良好市民，
一旦他們被標籤化，社區內難免產生芥蒂、誤會，不利於社會和諧。

Fake Refugees Seriously Threaten Community Security

"""
Liu Peiyu believes that the current problem of torture claims 
will have a significant negative impact on Hong Kong's racial integration efforts.

This is because some bogus refugees who came to Hong Kong under torture claims 
have damaged the law and order and environment of the community. 
At the same time, they are also greatly damaging the image 
of the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong.

Many of these ethnic minorities, who were born and raised in Hong Kong, 
have called Hong Kong home for several generations, 
identify with the values of Hong Kong society, and are good citizens.
Once they are stigmatized, 
it is inevitable that the community will have misunderstandings and misconceptions, 
which is not conducive to social harmony.
