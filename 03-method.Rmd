# Methods {#methods}

After reviewing both the theories of the impact of national identity on xenophobia as well as how political camps in Hong Kong imagine the city's national identity, how could we know the possible associations between each camp's definition of the city's national identity and its attitude towards asylum seekers who are mainly non-ethnic Chinese? This section will discuss the strategy of answering this question.

## Hypotheses

Based on the aforementioned literature in the previous section, I will formulate hypotheses to be tested and explain why I expect them to go in certain directions. The main hypothesis to be tested will be:

> H~1~: Pro-Beijing media outlets are more likely to negatively portray asylum seekers than media outlets from other political camps.

I expect the pro-Beijing camp news media to frame asylum seekers more negatively based on the literature on the relationship between national identity and xenophobia (e.g. @hjermNationalIdentityComparison1998a and @heathBritishNationalIdentity2005a ) which states that a more ethnic-based conception of national identity is generally associated with a higher degree of xenophobia towards immigrants, of which asylum seekers is one of the (most vulnerable) subgroups of immigrants. Accordingly, since pro-Beijing politicians and officials (including the Chinese President *Xi Jinping* himself) [@linMakeChinaGreat2021] resort heavily to ethnic-based discourses for justifying Chineseness of the Hong Kong identity, pro-Beijing media outlets can be expected to hold more negative attitudes towards the mostly non-ethnic Chinese non-refoulement claimants. In particular, the pro-Beijing camp's emphasis on how Hong Kong citizens belong to the greater Chinese national identity based on shared ethnicity with mainland Chinese might lead to its affiliated media outlets to portray asylum seekers as a threat to society since their ethnic distinctiveness marks them as ever-being strangers of the family of the majority Chinese population as @erniWhoNeedsStrangers2012 describes.

By contrast, since the pro-democracy camp focuses more on civic values (e.g. civil liberties, the rule of law) while defining the Hong Kong identity, the non-Chineseness of asylum seekers should appear less threatening to the Hong Kong identity from the pro-democracy camp's point of view. Lastly, the localist camp's primary focus on the mainland-Hong-Kong division regarding the city's identity again prevents a clear direction for H~1~ from being formulated beforehand.

## Data collection

I will study news media reports on asylum seekers and non-refoulement claimants in Hong Kong by local mass media during the year of 2019. Specifically, media publishing in **Chinese** in printed format will be included in the data[^1]. For the retrieval of the relevant newspaper articles, I will rely on the *WiseNews* database which can fetch news articles with search keywords published in Hong Kong[^2]. While it would have been more ideal to also include online news media into the dataset as @leeChangingPoliticalEconomy2018 mentions that they have become quite prominent in the 2010s for providing counter-narratives to the mainstream media which are often co-opted by the Chinese Government[^3], WiseNews does not directly provide the texts of online media news article and thus requires additional steps of web scrapping which are, unfortunately, beyond the author's capacity by the time of writing. That being said, including only the printed news media during 2019 would still cover 16 of the well-known news media with associations to different political camps according to the survey on media credibility by the Chinese University of Hong Kong [@cuhkPublicEvaluationMedia2020]. In other words, just searching for printed news media outlets still allows me to discover whether the attitudes of reporting on asylum seekers by some of the most well-known and widely circulated media outlets in Hong Kong might be related to their political associations.

[^1]: The full list of the included newspaper outlets is provided in *table 3.1*.

[^2]: I would like to thank my friend in Hong Kong helping me gain access to the database, which would otherwise have been extremely difficult.

[^3]: It should be noted, however, that by the very beginning of 2022, several online media outlets such as *Stand News* has defuncted after the flagship pro-Democracy newspaper outlet *Apple Daily* had dissolved in June 2021. The implication of this phenomenon to the media's narrative on asylum seekers in Hong Kong will be discussed further in the conclusion section.

The reason for choosing to collect media reports published in 2019 is because it was when the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment protest first broke out in June and then lasted for several months, a period when one can argue the manifestation of political ideologies should be the most salient for all the political camps. This should indeed be the case for both the pro-democracy camp whose supporters participated in several large-scale protests and sometimes even engaged in numerous violent clashes with the Hong Kong police to oppose a law that would have permitted extradition of fugitives to mainland China, and the pro-Beijing camp whose authority was once again immensely challenged after the 2014 Umbrella Movement. Accordingly, it would be interesting to investigate whether the issue of asylum seekers still remained its salience and was reported in similar manners given the co-occurrence of another arguably more salient political event (i.e. the anti-Extradition Law protests), as compared to when the issue first had become prominent back in 2016. Specifically, analysing newspaper articles in 2019 provides an opportunity to observe whether and how asylum seekers in Hong Kong might be represented by the media in tandem with major political events.

It is worth discussing some of the limitations of using media reports as the data for this thesis. For starters, media reports do not necessarily reflect how individuals identifying with each political camp might perceive asylum seekers directly and might not be fit for investigating the causal mechanism of how definition of Hong Kong's national identity may cause a political camp to frame asylum seekers in particular ways. Despite these shortcomings, media reports can still adequately help prompt the hypothesis of whether depictions of asylum seekers in Hong Kong might be associated with their political camp's definition of the city's national identity. In fact, previous research about the framing of asylum seekers by mass media [@cooperMediaCoverageRefugees2017; @mckayAnyOneThese2011; @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019; @odohertyAsylumSeekersBoat2007] point to its potential impact on affecting how the public may perceive the issue via being a major provider of related information, and sometimes these media reports may even serve to justify policymaking or reflect the government's position on the issue. Drawing from @fongInbetweenLiberalAuthoritarianism2017 and @leeChangingPoliticalEconomy2018, the media industry in Hong Kong is quite remarked for their political stances, and quite a number of outlets have their owners being affiliated with the Chinese and/or HKSAR Governments. Therefore, reports published by media outlets should be able to reflect political camps' attitudes towards asylum seekers and, perhaps more importantly, the version of framing that they would like to persuade their readers to accept, thereby making them a suitable data source to test the hypotheses proposed above.

Language-wise, including only Chinese-language news media omits how asylum seekers may be represented by English-language media in Hong Kong (e.g. the South China Morning Post) and thus cannot investigate whether the representation of asylum seekers by media outlets to potential non-Chinese audience may also vary based on each outlet's political affiliation. Moreover, solely focusing on textual content of the media reports means discarding graphical and (if also published online) audio-visual materials accompanied in a given news report, which may contain additional information that are not observed in the texts of news articles. Nevertheless, analysing the textual content of the media reports should still yield a considerable amount of information about the representation of asylum seekers in Hong Kong by media outlets linked to different political camps, since after all a large proportion of the content in news reports are represented textually.

To search for relevant media reports on WiseNews, I will refer to the keywords used by @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019 which refer to the group of population-in-interest. These terms can either be directly describing this group of population (e.g. refugees, illegal immigrants) or policies related to asylum seeking (e.g. non-refoulement claim, immigration paper). *Table 3.1* lists all the Chinese terms used for searching the relevant news articles on WiseNews and their meanings in English. Additional notes are used for indicating whether some articles were omitted and why. The author also omitted articles only mentioning the keywords briefly throughout the main text which discusses issues not directly related to asylum seekers. As for the keywords "South Asian", "illegal immigration" and "human snake", the author only included news entries fetched from these keywords if at least one of the other keywords directly referring to asylum seekers (i.e. non-refoulement claim(ant), torture claim(ant), asylum seeking, refugee and immigration paper) co-appeared in either the title or main text. This is to ensure that the news articles in the dataset are obviously describing non-refoulement claimants in Hong Kong.

## Modelling

Since the period under study spans for the year 2019, the dataset contains almost 700 articles in total which would be extremely time- and resource-consuming to qualitatively analyse each article line by line, whereas only focusing on a small subset of the articles may risk losing generalisability. On the other hand, while it is true that using human coding (whether it be done by trained experts or crowd coding platforms) for sentiment analysis will be likely to yield the most accurate results as @vanatteveldtValiditySentimentAnalysis2021 have noted, doing so will be too resource-intensive for a master-level thesis, and this method may also fall short of reliability, i.e. how other researchers may replicate the study if wanted.

Despite some of the caveats listed by @vanatteveldtValiditySentimentAnalysis2021 (e.g. accidentally identifying spurious relationships between variables, problem of overfitting) which can be remedied with corresponding solutions, I will use supervised machine learning to test the hypothesis. This means H~1~ will be treated as a sentiment analysis problem which classifies the *polarity* of the news articles (i.e. whether they reported on asylum seekers *positively, neutrally or negatively*). How the independent (both the media outlet's political camp and other controls) and dependent variables are operationalised and coded will be discussed in the next section, and for now I will talk about what kinds of tools and models will be used for the analysis.

Starting with the models that will be used for the analysis, I will rely on some commonly used classification models for textual analysis. Candidate models include naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting, among which I will choose one based on the model evaluation metrics on how well they can predict the sentiment of the news articles. Although @vanatteveldtValiditySentimentAnalysis2021 also mention that deep learning is another popular choice of machine learning model for sentiment analysis tasks, the author did not use such a model for this paper due to the relatively small size of the dataset at hand as well as the difficulty of interpreting the features' impact on the dependent variable directly from neural network models. The metrics that will be used for judging which model performs better will be *f1 score* and *log loss*. To briefly recap, f1 score is the harmonic mean of *precision* and *recall*:

$f1 score=frac{left(2cdot precisioncdot recallright)}{precision+recall}$

Using f1 score to evaluate how well the models perform. Besides f1 score, log loss will also be used for evaluating each model's performance. In essence, log loss not only tells how but also how certain the model is in making such predictions.

<!--# evaluation metrics still need elaboration and explain why I used them -->

The author will also transform the news articles into a term-document matrix which records the frequency of each word (i.e. token) appearing in each article (i.e. document) so that the format suitable for training machine learning models. Specifically, I will try both a simple bag-of-words approach and the term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) matrix which also considers in how many documents a word appears out of all the documents in the corpus, since words frequently appearing across documents may not be very helpful in identifying the sentiment of the articles. The implementation of NB, SVM as well as the term-document matrix transformation will be done via the `scikit-learn` package in Python [@pedregosaScikitlearnMachineLearning2011], whereas the tokenisation of the Chinese-language news articles will be assisted by the `jieba` package which is designed for doing natural language processing in Chinese [@junyiJieba2021]. For better tokenisation of the articles, I will also remove stop words, punctuations and hyper-links of the texts and add words related to Hong Kong politics (downloaded from @elgarteoHKPolDictHongKong2021) and asylum seekers into the dictionary. As for the gradient boosting model, I will use the `CatBoost` model since it offers the most flexibility in dealing with categorical variables for tree-based models [@prokhorenkovaCatBoostUnbiasedBoosting2017].

## Operationalisation

### Main independent variable

Starting from the main independent variable which classifies the associated political camp of the media outlets, I will mainly refer to the literature exploring how Hong Kong's media industry is intertwined with politics and perform additional research when needed. I consulted the articles by @fongInbetweenLiberalAuthoritarianism2017 and @leeChangingPoliticalEconomy2018 on the development of post-1997 Hong Kong's media industry, of which they have documented the co-optation of Hong Kong media outlets by the Chinese Government (e.g. the major shareholders holding positions in such as Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference). Building on the concept of "allocative control" (p.11) by @leeChangingPoliticalEconomy2018 about media outlet owners having the ultimate decision on the personnel and resources at the newsroom's disposal for reporting news which may lead to self-censorship of the frontline journalists, I will code media outlets whose owners are affiliated with the official Chinese and/or Hong Kong Government organisations as belonging to the pro-Beijing camp. As for those media owners with less apparent links with the Chinese or Hong Kong Governments, I will decide the classification according to whether the owners are known to be affiliated with a certain political camp and how a given media outlet is perceived for its political stance. Media outlets without apparent political stances are labelled as "neutral". *Table 3.2* is the resulting classification scheme. Note that due to the medium of publication of localist news media being almost exclusively online, none of the outlets in that camp was included in the dataset. Therefore, it would not be possible to examine how the localist media outlets might report on asylum seekers and non-refoulement claimants in news articles.

### Dependent variable

As mentioned before, the dependent variable of H~1~ will be the sentiment of the news articles towards asylum seekers in the polarities of *positive*, *neutral* and *negative*. But how exactly should these three polarities mean in this context? Again referring to the literature can help devise a sound coding scheme. Drawing @mckayAnyOneThese2011, @cooperMediaCoverageRefugees2017 and @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019, *positive* articles usually acclaim the person or event in concern, describe personal stories, report expert opinions without derogatory terms or depict refugees favourably, *neutral* articles simply report an incident without an overt sentiment or opinion towards particular stakeholders and with little interpretation by the journalists, and *negative* articles frame asylum seekers either as bringing problems to the host society or use inaccurate terms to delegitimise this group of population. I will follow these coding criteria for the polarities of the news articles in the dataset since these definitions suit the purpose of this study. The numerical representation of the polarities in the dataset will be as follows, namely, positive articles will be coded as `2`, neutral articles will be coded as `1`, and negative articles will be coded as `0`.

For the context of Hong Kong about the "incorrect" terms and information used for describing asylum seekers, I will refer to expert opinions about whether descriptions of asylum seekers in Hong Kong are founded[^4]. For example, @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019 point out that the term "fake/bogus refugees" (*jia3 nan4min2)* should be considered as both derogatory and inaccurate because those applying for non-refoulement claims are not automatically qualified as refugees while awaiting the final decisions of their applications. *Therefore, the polarity of news articles in which the news media directly refers to non-refoulement claimants as "fake refugees" in its reportage can be coded as negative, but the report should be coded at least as neutral instead if the news outlet is merely quoting someone who describes non-refoulement claimants as "fake refugees".* Furthermore, @ngCriminalizingInnocentsSocial2020 mentions that non-refoulement claimants are forced to be illegal immigrants by the policy design of the HKSAR Government so that this group of population can be excluded from social rights that legal residents enjoy. News articles equating non-refoulement claimants as illegal immigrants will thus also be coded as negative since such reportage is justifying the exclusion of non-refoulement claimants by resorting to their illegality that had been forced upon by the Government.

[^4]: A detailed discussion of the validity of the depiction of asylum seekers in Hong Kong can be found in @ngCriminalizingInnocentsSocial2020 and @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019.

### Control variables

It would also be interesting to incorporation some control variables to see if the association between political camps and polarities of the news articles still remains significant afterwards. For starters, the month of when the news articles were published will be included. Since 2019 was also the year when one of the most large-scale and long-lasting pro-democracy protests broke out, It would be interesting to see how asylum seekers may be portrayed during the peak of the protest (i.e. from June to November). Moreover, the presence of racial labels will also be included as a control, since it is possible that more overtly racialised discourses may be associated with more negative sentiments towards asylum seekers in general according to the literature. This variable will be named `Racial_label` in the dataset and will be binary, with `1` meaning there is presence of racial labels in the main text and `0` otherwise. Racial labels referring to both regional (e.g. South Asia, Africa) and national (e.g. the nationalities included in figure 2.2) will be counted. Lastly, the metadata of the news articles, namely the character counts of titles and main texts, will also be added to see if the lengths of the articles may also be associated with the sentiment towards asylum seekers.
