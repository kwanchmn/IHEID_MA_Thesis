Thesis final edit to do list:

Literature review and introduction
- [x] 	Emphasis on current literature and what is lacking
- [x] 	Also think about the broader literature (e.g. how does ethnic and civic identities play)
- [x] 	A good case how polit. Division shape political identity in affecting asylum seekers

Hypothesis
- [x] 	More early for theory prediction of how political camps may respond according to national identity and theoretical expectation (before empirical evidence)
- [x] 	No entries for localist camp, so no direct translation

Analysis
- [x] 	Put figure 4.1 right after table 3.1
- [x] 	Helpful to discuss pro-democracy news outlets, e.g. how Apple Daily can operate and non-pro-Beijing in general (many ppl read Apple Daily, closure attracted foreign media)

Summary of results 
- [x] 	Ambivalence of problem and solution, may be discussed with multiple angles 
- [x] 	Also higher variance for positive class prediction
- [x] 	Much smaller size of pro-democracy outlets, extract of articles between two camps (Very different)

Conclusion
- [ ] Negative narrative may actually translate to more hostility against non-refoulement claimants in the future
