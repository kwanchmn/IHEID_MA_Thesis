# Introduction {#intro}

Asylum seekers, defined by \@amnestyinternationalRefugeesAsylumseekersMigrants2022 as individuals who are forced to flee from their home countries due to threats of persecutions and human rights violations, has become one of the most salient socio-political issues

Despite having their presence recorded annually since 2005 \[\@immigrationdepartmentEnforcementStatisticsNonrefoulement2021\], Given the extremely small number of non-refoulement claimants, the issue of asylum seeking regime in Hong Kong hadn't gained much attention until early 2016, after a senior Immigration Department official's accusation of the USM being abused during a TV interview in October 2015 and the subsequent propagation of two fabricated WhatsApp audios alleging asylum seekers as perpetrators of robberies and homicides in the New Territories district [@ngFramingIssueAsylum2019] . Soon afterwards, coverage of asylum seekers by newspaper media has increased, with two pro-Beijing newspapers named *The Sun* (which ceased publication in April 2016) and *Oriental Daily* contributing to the largest proportion of articles which depict this group of vulnerable population as a source of social problems (e.g. committing crimes) which warrant stringent measures like detention camps as solutions [@ngFramingIssueAsylum2019].

Since the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997, Hong Kong has witnessed increasing tension with its new sovereign owner. Until July 2020 when the HKSAR[^1] Government passed the National Security Law and the subsequent commencement of the large-scale suppression of the opposition camp such as the mass arrest of 53 pro-democracy activists in January 2021 [@bbcNationalSecurityLaw2021], protests against the authority of the HKSAR and Beijing Governments had occurred. Apart from the annual July 1 protest since 2003, the two most prominent political movements would be the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the more recent 2019 anti-extradition law protest which created considerable attention from other countries as well.

This thesis thus aims to investigate ***how may the framing of asylum seekers in Hong Kong vary by news media outlets associated with different political camps, given each of them has considerably different definition of the city's national identity.*** The academic contribution of this thesis .

The academic contribution of this thesis is twofold. The first contribution

Meanwhile, the second contribution is more methodological in the sense that I

Given the huge volume of information generated each day in the 21st Century (for example it is estimated that 2.5e18 bytes of data were generated per day in 2020 according to \@marrHowMuchData2018), it is likely to become more and more difficult for manually coding textual data for analysis despite the validity of this approach,

Contextualising this thesis into the broader literature of how definitions of national identity may affect perceptions towards immigrants,

Before moving on, it should be mentioned that I will use the words "asylum seekers", "refugees" and "non-refoulement claimants" interchangeably. It is true that difference exists between the definitions of asylum seekers and refugees[^2]. Nevertheless, since the above three terms are generally used to refer to the same group of population in Hong Kong who flee from their own countries to escape from threats of torture, treating these terms as synonyms in this context should better cover how this group of population is perceived by media outlets in different political camps. In fact, scholars researching on this issue often use the terms I listed without strictly differentiating them (e.g. @vecchioAsylumSeekingGlobal2014, @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019).

[^2]: Formally speaking, *asylum seekers* refer to individuals who still have pending applications of their asylum status, whereas *refugees* refer to those who have gained recognition from the UN for being forced to flee from their countries due to threats on their personal securities [@ngCriminalizingInnocentsSocial2020].

This thesis will proceed as follow. In section 2, I will review the literature on the theories about how the perception of national identity might affect attitudes towards immigration, how each major political camp in Hong Kong perceives the national identity of Hong Kong, and how each camp perceives asylum seekers. Section 3 explains how the hypothesis is formulated and what will be the expected direction, how the data was collected and pre-processed, what kind of models will be used for the analysis and how the variables will be operationalised. Section 4 records the process of the data analysis from preliminary exploring the data to modelling them, presents the results and discusses the findings. Section 5 concludes this thesis and mentions the potential implications of the findings.
