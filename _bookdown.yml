# If you specify a sub directory with rmd_subdir, then bookdown will search through this
# folder too
rmd_subdir: ["front-matter","chapters"]
# Make sure to start any acknowledgements and/or abstract Rmd files with
# an underscore, e.g. _abstract.Rmd.
# Otherwise bookdown will start to merge the abstract in to the body text which almost
# certainly isn't what you want
# Alternatively, you can comment out rmd_subdir and specify manually what files to include with rmd_files
# rmd_files: ["Untitled.Rmd", "chapters/01-basics.Rmd", "front-and-back-matter/99-references.Rmd"]

# The following can be changed to another folder if you wish
output_dir: "versions"

# Please suggest and submit changes to the source .Rmd files here:
