大狀：入境處對弱勢缺乏同情	

"""
【本報訊】曾收留斯諾登的香港三個難民家庭早前曾向港府申請酷刑聲請，全部被拒。
其中獲加拿大批准難民身份的Vanessa在港生活近20年，她認為港府將申請庇護者當作香港的垃圾。
在港難民沒有工作、沒有金錢、沒有希望和未來，有如生活在地獄之中。
協助她的大律師田光譽（Robert Tibbo，圖）向《蘋果》稱，加拿大的難民篩選制度遠較香港透明和公平，
形容香港是「種族主義、歧視、排斥和迫害的世界」。港府審查制度不透明田光譽向《蘋果》表示，
Vanessa及其女兒在香港遭受歧視和邊緣化，她不被允許工作，
亦沒有足夠的人道主義援助滿足其基本需求，其女兒更因膚色多次遭受種族歧視。

Barristers: ImmD Lacks Compassion for the Disadvantaged	

"""
The three refugee families in Hong Kong who had taken in Snowden had applied 
to the Hong Kong government for torture claims, all of which were rejected.

One of them, Vanessa, who was granted refugee status by Canada, 
has been living in Hong Kong for nearly 20 years, 
and she thinks the Hong Kong government treats asylum seekers like trash.

Refugees in Hong Kong have no jobs, no money, no hope or future, and are like living in hell.
Robert Tibbo (pictured), the barrister who assisted her, 
told Apple Daily that Canada's refugee screening system is far more transparent and fair than Hong Kong's.
He described Hong Kong as "a world of racism, discrimination, exclusion and persecution. 

The Hong Kong government's screening system is not transparent," Tibbo told The Apple.
Vanessa and her daughter are discriminated against and marginalized in Hong Kong. She is not allowed to work,
there is not enough humanitarian aid to meet her basic needs, 
and her daughter has suffered repeated racial discrimination because of her skin color.
