# IHEID_MA_Thesis

This repository includes the codes used for the analysis in my master thesis submitted as the requirement of the master's programme in the International Relations/Political Science Department at IHEID. The file ***Chin_Man_KWAN_MA_Thesis_final.pdf*** contains the whole passage of it.

## Abstract 
Asylum seekers (or formally non-refoulement claimants) have started to draw attention in Hong
Kong’s public debate since early 2016 after a senior official from the Immigration Department
claimed that the city’s mechanism of screening asylum seekers was being abused. Not unseen
in other places, this group of vulnerable population has then started to be portrayed by some
media outlets pejoratively, such as being questioned for the genuineness of their
non-refoulement applications as “fake refugees”. When Hong Kong embroiled into one of its
largest conflict between pro-democracy protesters and the HKSAR Government in 2019 and
both the pro-Beijing and opposition camps manifested their respective political ideology
saliently, how might the depiction of non-refoulement claimants vary according to a media
outlet’s affiliated political camp which has its own conception of Hong Kong’s national identity?
This thesis aims to investigate this question by using machine-learning-based sentiment
analysis on news articles reporting on non-refoulement claimants published in 2019 by printed
newspapers in Hong Kong. It is found that, in general, pro-Beijing media outlets were more
likely to portray non-refoulement claimants negatively than outlets with other political stances.
With the promulgation of the National Security Law in mid-2020 and the recent closures of
several pro-democracy newspaper outlets, one can expect that the narrative on asylum seekers
in Hong Kong will be further dominated by pro-Beijing media outlets, thereby potentially
fostering a more hostile social environment against those who seek refuge in Hong Kong due to
facing threats of tortures in their home countries.

## What are the folders for
Aside from the .Rmd files which store both the texts and codes used for writing my thesis, the folders listed in this repo serve the following purposes respectively:
* Coding: python scripts used for parsing the news articles downloaded from *WiseNews* to tabular format
* bib: references used for this thesis
* data: datasets used for the analysis
* figures: to paste Chinese-language texts into the main text body
* models: storing the trained and tuned XGBoost model
* versions: a log of the past versions of my thesis
