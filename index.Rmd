Perhaps one of the most salient challenges facing the world in the 21st Century will be the massive movement of asylum seekers and refugees across national borders who are forced to flee from their home countries due to threats from persecutions and human rights violations [@amnestyinternationalRefugeesAsylumseekersMigrants2022], and the 2015 Refugee Crisis in Europe is undoubtedly one of the most high-profile incidents on this issue. Political scientists have continuously inquired the relationship between identity politics and the attitudes towards immigrants (of which asylum seekers are a subgroup) of the public and policymakers, with a considerable amount of work focusing on the European context (e.g. @borzelEuroSchengenCrises2018; @nouryIdentityPoliticsPopulism2020 ). There certainly exists various entry points for one to investigate the politics related to asylum seeking, but the mass media's rhetoric on asylum seekers is often under academic scrutiny because this is regarded as one of the most prominent ways for potentially influencing public perceptions of asylum seekers as per the literature, given mass media's role as one of the most accessible and popular sources of information for the public to know about affairs of the world [@cooperMediaCoverageRefugees2017; @mckayAnyOneThese2011; @ngFramingIssueAsylum2019] .

How do these two phenomena inspired me to write about how the media portray asylum seekers (or more formally, non-refoulement claimants) residing in Hong Kong? Starting with the issue of asylum seeker *per se*, Hong Kong has been a destination for refuge for the second half of the 20th Century (first for those fleeing from mainland China during the Maoist period and then Vietnamese facing threats of persecutions after the Vietnam War).

The media landscape in Hong Kong

Even though Hong Kong is never a signatory of the 1951 Refugee Convention and thus is not obligated to host refugees within its territory, the Government still has to provide refuge to those who flee from their countries of origin due to

My inspiration for writing on this topic comes from several sources. For starters, .

Furthermore, I would like to take the opportunity of researching on this important topic to test whether machine learning

The process of the research for this thesis was quite long and not without difficulties. First of all, given the vast volume of literature related to asylum seekers based on numerous perspectives and levels of analysis, it was quite easy to often get lost. In the end, I decided to focus on the literature of how the definition of national identity may affect the perceptions towards immigrants (of which asylum seekers are a subgroup) because the political division in Hong Kong is arguably more defined based on how the identity of Hong Kong citizens should be defined, even though it is equally valid to classify the political parties according to the more conventional left-right dimensions [@maPoliticalPartiesElections2012].

The data collection and preprocessing part also took quite a considerable amount of time. Apart from only filtering out relevant news articles about non-refoulement claimants published by newspapers in 2019, the messy nature of text data also required a lot of steps to transform them into a format suitable for being model inputs. The fact that the data set did not have

As much as there are numerous performant machine learning models available nowadays, the result will not be very meaningful if the data quality is not optimal.
